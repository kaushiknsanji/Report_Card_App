This App has been developed as part of the **Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Course** for the Exercise Project "ReportCard". This project has no UI components. It is just a Java class, rather than a full Android App. It contains only a Model Class [ReportCard](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/reportcardpojo/models/ReportCard.java) that helps in managing and recording a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year.

## Rubric followed for the Project

* Class contains appropriate variables to track information which belongs on a report card. 
* Class should not contain variables which should belong, for instance, to a student, a teacher, a school, or a textbook.
* Class contains at least one constructor which properly instantiates each variable in the class.
* Private variables which might be read off of a report card should have a getter method to access them.
* Constants contained in the class are never modified, and are logical choices for constant values.
* All private variables require a setter method.
* Class contains a `toString()` method which returns the contents of the class in a human-readable string. The `toString()` method should properly use the `@Override` annotation.
* All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
